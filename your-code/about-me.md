My name is Paula Iglesias Barge and I am from Vigo, Galicia. I am currently a growth hacker specialist at Ironhack Barcelona, and a tech marketeer. I am specialized in Content Marketing and SEO and I am also the Community Lead, so loads of events and partnerships are also on my list. 

I have always worked in tech as a marketeer but I don't have experience with technology or data besides creating content and organizing events for data people. Lately I have been practising Python and Excel but on a really beginner level. 

I joined the Data Analytics bootcamp because I have always loved the work Data Analyst do and the aspect of being analytical and detail oriented on a daily basis. As a marketeer I often find myself frustated because I want to analyze the behaviour, trends and performance of the campaigns I do, but hit a wall in terms of technical knowledge. 

Besides learning Python, Tableau, Statistics, Machine Learning and all the hard skills in the bootcamp, I expect to become much more detail oriented, train my analytical mind and above all, train my patience and perseverance because I know indeed, it is going to be a hard path coming from my backround with no previous experience whatsoever. 

In the near future, I would like to bring all this knowledge into my current position or eventually find a new job in the Data World or more related with Marketing Analytics or Data Analysis for a Startup!
